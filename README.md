# USAGE AND INSTALLATION
Simply drag and drop this resource in your ESX folder and start it using ```ensure esx_druglabs```. Telporters can be changed by changing the coords in the ```config.lua``` file.


**CHANGING TELEPORTER LOCATIONS**

Each teleporter is identified by the 'teleporters' pre-config tag. Enter equals to the entering position where pleyer can enter the IPL and where player will spawn when exiting the IPL, exit equals to the position where player will spawn when entering the IPL and where player can eventually exit the IPL.

**USAGE**

Players can enter each 'lab' when they have the needed key in their inventory. They can eventually produce drugs in these labs which they'll receive as an item in their inventory as end product.
